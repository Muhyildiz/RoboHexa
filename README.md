# RoboHexa

This repository contains the codebase for a hexapod robot designed for traversing hard terrain.

## Components

- MG996R Servo Motors: Actuates the six legs of the hexapod.
- STM32 Microcontroller: Controls servo motors and processes sensor data.
- IMU6050: Provides orientation and acceleration data for balance control.
- Button: User interface element for manual control or triggering actions.

## Features

- **Legged Locomotion:** Utilizes six legs for versatile movement on rough terrain.
- **Balance Control:** Integrated IMU6050 sensor ensures stability and adaptation to surface conditions.
- **User Interface:** Includes a button for user interaction, enabling manual control or predefined actions.
