The robot's stability has been enhanced by implementing a PID controller, allowing it to maintain balance effectively. This controller utilizes an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the MPU6050, to accurately calculate roll and pitch angles.

Two controllers have been designed: one for roll correction and another for pitch correction. These controllers work in parallel, combining their efforts to maintain stability even on challenging landscapes.
