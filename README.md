The steps line of the project:
* Literature Research
* Mechanical Design Building
* Motor Calibration
* Basic Behaviour and Motion Control

## Components

- **MG996R Servo Motors:** Actuates the six legs of the hexapod.
- **STM32 Microcontroller:** Controls servo motors and processes sensor data.
- **IMU6050 Sensor:** Provides orientation and acceleration data for balance control.
- **Mini Switch:** To get data when each leg touches the ground.

  
## Electrical 

- **PCB**: Custom designed to manage wires 

  
## Features

- **PID:** Utilizes six legs for versatile movement on rough terrain.
