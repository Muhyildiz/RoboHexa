The steps line of the project:
* Literature Research
* Mechanical Design Building
* Motor Calibration
* Basic Behaviour and Motion Control

## Components

- **MG996R Servo Motors:** Actuates the six legs of the hexapod.
- **STM32 Microcontroller:** Controls servo motors by PWM signal and processes sensor data.
- **IMU6050 Sensor:** Provides orientation and acceleration data for balance control.
- **NRF24L01 Transceiver Module:** Remotely controlling the Robot using NRF24L01.
- **Mini Switch:** To get data when each leg touches the ground.

  
## Electrical 

- **PCB**: The custom PCB was meticulously engineered to maximize power efficiency and optimize heat dissipation capabilities. It also handles the connection of 18 PWM signals, SPI, and I2C communication, highlighting its advanced functionality in electronic systems.
